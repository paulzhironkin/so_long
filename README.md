# Ecole 42: So_long

In this project I made a small 2D game with basic gameplay

Project workes on MiniLibX graphical library

### How it works:

1) The playerâ€™s goal is to collect all collectibles present on the map and then escape with minimal movement.
2) The player is able to move up (press W), down (press S), left (press A) and right (press D). Player can close the game by pressing ESC.
3) The map is constructed with 4 components:
* Player - 'P'
* Exit - 'E'
* Wall - '1'
* Free space - '0'
4) `map.ber` map example is stored in repo. Fell free to change it, to create your own map. `.ber` format is required.

### How to launch the game:

1) Game issuitable for MacOS
2) Clone repo and promt "make":
```Bash
$ make
```
